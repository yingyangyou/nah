## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `nah test --config` flag for inline JSON config overrides — enables testing config variants (profile, classify, actions, content patterns) without writing to `~/.config/nah/config.yaml` (FD-076)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-11

Initial release.

### Added

- PreToolUse hook guarding all 6 Claude Code tools (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep) plus MCP tools — sensitive path protection, hook self-protection, project boundary enforcement, content inspection for secrets and destructive payloads
- 20-action taxonomy with deterministic structural classification — commands classified by action type (not name), pipe composition rules detect exfiltration and RCE patterns, shell unwrapping prevents bypass via `bash -c`, `eval`, here-strings
- Flag-dependent classifiers for context-sensitive commands — git (12 dual-behavior commands), curl/wget/httpie (method detection), sed/tar (mode detection), awk (code execution detection), find, global install escalation
- Optional LLM layer for ambiguous decisions — Ollama, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Snowflake Cortex providers with automatic cascade, three-way decisions (allow/block/uncertain), conversation context from Claude Code transcripts, configurable eligibility and max decision cap
- YAML config system — global (`~/.config/nah/config.yaml`) + per-project (`.nah.yaml`) with tighten-only merge for supply-chain safety. Taxonomy profiles (full/minimal/none), custom classifiers, configurable safety lists, content patterns, and sensitive paths
- CLI — `nah install/uninstall/update`, `nah test` for dry-run classification across all tools, `nah types/log/config/status`, rule management via `nah allow/deny/classify/trust/forget`
- JSONL decision logging with content redaction, verbosity filtering, 5MB rotation, and `nah log` CLI with tool/decision filters
- Context-aware path resolution — same command gets different decisions based on project boundary, sensitive directories, trusted paths, and database targets
- Fail-closed error handling — internal errors block instead of silently allowing, config parse errors surface actionable hints, 16 formerly-silent error paths now emit stderr diagnostics
- MCP tool support — generic `mcp__*` classification with supply-chain safety (project config cannot reclassify MCP tools)
