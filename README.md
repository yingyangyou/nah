## The problem

Claude Code's permission system is all-or-nothing. Allow a tool, and the agent can do anything with it. Deny lists are trivially bypassed — deny `rm`, the agent uses `unlink`. Deny that, it uses `python -c "import os; os.remove()"`.

Meanwhile, nobody guards Read, Write, Edit, Glob, or Grep at all. The agent can read your SSH keys and write malicious scripts unchecked.

## Install

```bash
pip install nah
nah install
```

That's it. Two commands. Zero config required — sensible defaults out of the box.

Also supports Cortex Code:

```bash
nah install                    # Claude Code (default)
nah install --agent cortex     # Cortex Code
nah install --agent all        # both
```

## What it guards

nah is a [PreToolUse hook](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) that intercepts **every** tool call before it executes:

| Tool | What nah checks |
|------|----------------|
| **Bash** | Structural command classification — action type, pipe composition, shell unwrapping |
| **Read** | Sensitive path detection (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `.env`, ...) |
| **Write** | Path check + content inspection (secrets, exfiltration, destructive payloads) |
| **Edit** | Path check + content inspection on the replacement string |
| **Glob** | Guards directory scanning of sensitive locations |
| **Grep** | Catches credential search patterns outside the project |
| **MCP tools** | Generic classification for third-party tool servers (`mcp__*`) |

## How it works

Every tool call hits a deterministic structural classifier first. Under 5ms. Zero tokens.

```
Claude: Edit → ~/.claude/hooks/nah_guard.py
  nah. Edit targets hook directory: ~/.claude/hooks/ (self-modification blocked)

Claude: Read → ~/.aws/credentials
  nah? Read targets sensitive path: ~/.aws (requires confirmation)

Claude: Bash → npm test
  ✓ allowed (package_run)

Claude: Write → config.py containing "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----"
  nah? Write content inspection [secret]: private key
```

**`nah.`** = blocked. **`nah?`** = asks for your confirmation. Everything else flows through silently.

### Context-aware, not pattern-matching

The same command gets different decisions based on context:

| Command | Context | Decision |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `rm dist/bundle.js` | Inside project | Allow |
| `rm ~/.bashrc` | Outside project | Ask |
| `git push --force` | History rewrite | Ask |
| `base64 -d \| bash` | Decode + exec pipe | Block |

### Optional LLM layer

For commands the structural classifier can't resolve (the ambiguous 10-20%), nah can optionally consult an LLM:

```
Tool call → nah (deterministic, <5ms) → LLM (optional) → Claude Code permissions → execute
```

The deterministic layer always runs first — the LLM only resolves leftover "ask" decisions. If no LLM is configured or available, the decision stays "ask" and the user is prompted.

Supported providers: Ollama (free, local), OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cortex.

## Configure

Works out of the box with zero config. When you want to tune it:

```yaml
# ~/.config/nah/config.yaml  (global)
# .nah.yaml                  (per-project, can only tighten)

# Override default policies for action types
actions:
  filesystem_delete: ask         # always confirm deletes
  git_history_rewrite: block     # never allow force push
  lang_exec: allow               # trust inline scripts

# Guard sensitive directories
sensitive_paths:
  ~/.kube: ask
  ~/Documents/taxes: block

# Teach nah about your commands
classify:
  database_destructive:
    - "psql -c DROP"
    - "mysql -e DROP"
```

nah classifies commands by **action type** (what kind of thing), not by command name (which command). Run `nah types` to see all 17 built-in action types with their default policies.

### Action types

Every command maps to an action type, and every action type has a default policy:

| Policy | Meaning | Example types |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `allow` | Always permit | `filesystem_read`, `git_safe`, `package_run` |
| `context` | Check path/project context, then decide | `filesystem_write`, `filesystem_delete`, `network_outbound` |
| `ask` | Always prompt the user | `git_history_rewrite`, `lang_exec`, `process_signal` |
| `block` | Always reject | `obfuscated` |

### Taxonomy profiles

Choose how much built-in classification to start with:

```yaml
# ~/.config/nah/config.yaml
profile: full      # full | minimal | none
```

- **full** (default) — comprehensive coverage across shell, git, packages, containers, and more
- **minimal** — curated essentials only (rm, git, curl, kill, ...)
- **none** — blank slate — bring your own taxonomy

### LLM configuration

```yaml
# ~/.config/nah/config.yaml
llm:
  enabled: true
  max_decision: ask              # cap: LLM can't escalate past "ask"
  providers: [openrouter]        # cascade order
  openrouter:
    url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions
    key_env: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
    model: google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview
```

### Supply-chain safety

Project `.nah.yaml` can **add** classifications and **tighten** policies, but can never relax them. A malicious repo can't use `.nah.yaml` to whitelist dangerous commands — only your global config has that power.

## CLI

### Core

```bash
nah install                # install hook (supports --agent claude|cortex|all)
nah uninstall              # clean removal
nah update                 # update hook after pip upgrade
nah config show            # show effective merged config
nah config path            # show config file locations
```

### Test & inspect

```bash
nah test "rm -rf /"              # dry-run Bash classification
nah test --tool Read ~/.ssh/id_rsa   # test any tool, not just Bash
nah test --tool Write ./out.txt      # test Write with content inspection
nah types                        # list all action types with default policies
nah log                          # show recent hook decisions
nah log --blocks                 # show only blocked decisions
nah log --tool Bash -n 20        # filter by tool, limit entries
nah log --json                   # machine-readable output
```

### Manage rules

Adjust policies from the command line — no need to edit YAML:

```bash
nah allow filesystem_delete      # allow an action type
nah deny network_outbound        # block an action type
nah classify "docker rm" container_destructive  # teach nah a command
nah trust api.example.com        # trust a network host
nah allow-path ~/sensitive/dir   # exempt a path for this project
nah status                       # show all custom rules
nah forget filesystem_delete     # remove a rule
```

<h2 id="auto-mode">Works with Auto Mode</h2>

Anthropic's [Auto Mode](https://www.anthropic.com/news/enabling-claude-code-to-work-more-autonomously) lets Claude reason per-action about whether to auto-approve or prompt. nah complements it — they're different layers:

```
Tool call → nah (deterministic) → Auto Mode (probabilistic) → execute
```

| | Auto Mode | nah | Both |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Engine** | LLM reasoning | Deterministic rules + optional LLM | Hard floor + smart fallback |
| **Latency** | ~500ms-2s | <5ms deterministic | Faster on average |
| **Cost** | Extra tokens/call | Zero (LLM layer optional) | Reduced |
| **Prompt injection** | Vulnerable | Immune at the deterministic layer | Immune floor |
| **Content inspection** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Your rules** | Anthropic's black box | Your YAML | You control the floor |

Auto Mode makes Claude smarter about permissions. nah makes it impossible for that smartness to fail catastrophically.

## How it's different

**vs. deny lists** ([safety-net](https://github.com/kenryu42/claude-code-safety-net), [destructive_command_guard](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard)) — Pattern matching on command strings is trivially bypassed. nah resolves paths, inspects content, guards all 6 tools + MCP, and classifies by action type instead of command name.

**vs. OS sandboxes** ([nono](https://github.com/always-further/nono)) — Complementary layers. Sandboxes enforce at the OS level but can't distinguish safe from unsafe operations on allowed paths. nah adds the smart gate inside the OS fence. `pip install` on any machine with Python 3.

**vs. built-in permissions** — Not configurable enough. You can't say "allow deletes inside my project but ask outside." nah adds the granularity that's missing.

## Uninstall

```bash
nah uninstall
pip uninstall nah
```
